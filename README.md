## I dislike social media, github included.
Maintaining a public facing image drains me, and almost all of my work is done privately for corporations. I would love to have open source projects of my own in the wild someday. <br/>

For now, I work on AI, tools, and technical art for videogames. And rather more dull things for the department of defense. <br/>

If you'd like to talk about anything all, the only real way to get at me is through [Discord](https://discord.com/users/230440842521870336). I'm a big old nerd who loves art and building things. (send me your weird specific interest of the hour and we will probably get on great)
